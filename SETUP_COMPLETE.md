```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Credentials:**
   - Use **Bigpenger@gmail.com** for Firebase
   - Never commit `.env.local` (already gitignored)
   - Never commit `firebase-service-account.json` (already gitignored)

2. **First Run:**
   - Install dependencies first: `npm install`
   - Configure Firebase before seeding
   - Deploy security rules before using the app

3. **Content:**
   - Content is sourced from `cannabis-content-framework.json`
   - You can edit the JSON and re-run `npm run seed`
   - Or manage content through Firebase Console

4. **Security:**
   - Firestore rules are in `firestore.rules`
   - Storage rules are in `storage.rules`
   - Both must be deployed for the app to work

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase not initialized"
→ Check `.env.local` is filled in correctly
→ Restart dev server

### "Permission denied" 
→ Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### "Service account not found"
→ Download from Firebase Console
→ Save as `firebase-service-account.json` in root

### Articles not showing
→ Run `npm run seed`
→ Check Firebase Console → Firestore

### Need to start over?
→ Delete Firestore collections in Console
→ Run `npm run seed` again
