   - *Impact*: Visual only
   - *Fix*: Will be replaced with real user data in production

### Recommendations for Launch:
1. **Deploy Firestore Security Rules**: Run the deployment script before going live
2. **Set up Firebase Environment Variables**: Ensure all API keys are properly configured
3. **Enable Firebase Services**: 
   - Authentication providers (Email/Password, Google)
   - Firestore Database
   - Storage
   - Analytics (optional)
4. **Content Moderation**: Verify AI moderation service is properly configured
5. **Age Verification**: Test thoroughly to ensure compliance
